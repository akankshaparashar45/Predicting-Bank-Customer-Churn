# Predicting-Bank-Customer-Churn
Using Deep Learning (Neural Network)
# Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking sector. Identifying potential churners in advance enables banks to take proactive retention measures. In this project, we develop and compare various neural network models to classify customers as likely to churn or not.
# Business Objective
* Understand customer behaviour
* Predict customer churn
* Formulate strategies to combat churn rate
* Prevent revenue loss
# Dataset
- The dataset represents customer data from a bank
- It was provided by an educational institute for academic purposes
- The dataset contains 10,000 customer records with 14 features each
# Installation
* Option 1: Install dependencies locally
  
  ```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
 
    Note: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.

* Option 2:  Run on Google Colab

  - You can also open the Jupyter notebook directly in Google Colab without installing anything locally.
  - Note: Make sure to upload the dataset and required files to your Colab environment or mount Google Drive.
